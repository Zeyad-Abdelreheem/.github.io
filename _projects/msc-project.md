title: Multi-objective optimization using Reinforcement Learning for cellular networks 
layout: project 
year: 2024
project-url: TBA
excerpt: Implemented a Deep Q-Network (DDQN) with experience replay to address a dual-objective optimization problem in cellular networks, maximizing spectral efficiency while optimizing user equipment mobility management. Leveraged the NS3 simulator, NS3-Gym framework, Python, TensorFlow, and C++ for development and experimentation. Utilized TensorBoard for experiment tracking and analysis. A research paper detailing the work has been submitted for publication, with code release planned upon acceptance.
